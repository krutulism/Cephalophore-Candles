# Ladder-LEDs
KiCAD 7 files for a chainable PCB of individually addressable LEDs. 
## Abstract
Strips of individually addressable LEDs are a popular and versatile gadget. Here I develop my own degree of craftsmanship beyond the adhesive strips they often come packaged on.

The 'case' I will install them into are the empty rungs of a salvaged aluminum extension ladder.

## Decision Tree
In each cut-off rung I will install a custom PCB designed in KiCAD

The individually addressable LEDs I will use are the from Inolux.

The connector ecosystem that will allow me to chain these boards together are the Molex Nanofit system.

I will attempt to use a screw terminal block to mount the boards.

The prototype controller will be an Arduino.



## Instructions
To correct the paths to 3D models of custom library components: select a footprint in the PCB editor, edit its properties in the right click context menu or by pressing the E key, and enter the "3D Models" tab

CAD models I derived from datasheet drawings are included. CAD models I downloaded from the manufacturer can be downloaded from manufacturer websites.
